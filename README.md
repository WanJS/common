[DEPRECATION NOTE] This library is deprecated in favor of a newly conceptualized [wanchainjs-common](https://github.com/WanJS/wanchainjs-common) library with support for different chain and
hardfork settings.

If you use this library to read parameters for your own library, consider switching to the ``wanchainjs-common``
library on one of your next releases. 

# COMMON
